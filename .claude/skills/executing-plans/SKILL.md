# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** Upstream recommends `subagent-driven-development` (a fresh subagent
per task) where subagents are available. That skill is still deliberately not
installed here — the objection was always its ceremony, never delegation
itself (`docs/dev-workflow-guide.md` §9). Delegation without the ceremony now
exists as the project-local `delegating-plan-tasks` skill, invoked per task
from Step 2 below. **Inline execution remains the default**; a plan opts
individual tasks into delegation in its header. This skill is the execution
path for Tickwire either way.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Ensure a feature branch exists: `git checkout -b <phase-or-feature-slug> dev`
   (per `docs/dev-workflow-guide.md` §8 — branch per phase, incremental
   commits, self-merge into `dev`, no PR). The `using-git-worktrees` skill is
   available if real directory isolation is ever needed — e.g. two concurrent
   sessions on different phases — but a plain branch is the default here.
2. Read plan file
3. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
4. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
5. If no concerns: Create todos for the plan items and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. If the plan's header marks this task for delegation, use the
   `delegating-plan-tasks` skill — one subagent for the whole task, then
   verify at the task boundary per that skill's Rule 2 (full suite plus
   `git log --oneline dev..HEAD`, without re-reading the work). Otherwise
   execute inline.
3. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
4. Run verifications as specified
5. Mark as completed

Dispatch delegated tasks strictly one at a time. Plan tasks are not
independent: each consumes the previous task's `Produces` interfaces and
commits to the same branch, so parallel dispatch races the branch and briefs
later tasks against interfaces that do not exist yet.

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `finishing-a-development-branch` (installed
  project-locally at `.claude/skills/finishing-a-development-branch/` — no
  `superpowers:` prefix, that name doesn't resolve here)
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice
- In this project the expected choice is **Option 1, merge locally into `dev`**
  (CLAUDE.md: self-merge, no PR ceremony). Use `--no-ff` so the phase stays a
  visible merge commit — with `dev` unmoved the merge would otherwise
  fast-forward and erase the phase boundary.

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on `main` or `dev` without explicit user consent —
  in this project `dev` is the protected integration branch, not `main`
